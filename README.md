# iOS Projects Showcase

I am displaying two of my iOS projects here which I built when I was learning about development in iOS from youtube courses.

I built a music player and a reminders app. I learned about how files are managed by swift and how to write our code in a proper way.

Apart from iOS development in Swift, I have also built apps using Kotlin, Flutter and React Native.
